# Leak-Detection-Device-Database
Software for managing and displaying survey data in an SQLite database. Form is built with Qt PySide2 (GUI). 

The software also generates differnt types of plots and graphs using Matplotlib.

I have simplified a lot of the process by writing an SQLite wrapper to more easily call on SQL commands through Python. 

It is also possible to write raw SQL in an the Advance Search feature to intereact with the Database data.

I have not included the database as it contains private information.
